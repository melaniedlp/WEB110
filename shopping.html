    Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.  (There are many answers to this question. )
    You need if statements when you want to display certain results based on user input. 
    For example, if you own a business that offers senior discounts, then prompting a user to enter their age
    would activate a senior discount if it met the requirements. 

    When comparing values,  in what data type is the result stored? (number, string, or Boolean?)
    All comparison operators return a boolean value. It'll store whether the comparison is true or false.

    <script>


        "use strict";
        
        let shoppingTotal = Number(prompt('What is your shopping total?', '' ));
        
        let confirmed = confirm(`$${shoppingTotal} is this total correct?`);
        
        
        if (shoppingTotal >= 100 ){
            alert ("Total over $100 -> 20% discount!");
        }
        else if (shoppingTotal >= 50){
            alert("Total over $50 -> 10% discount!");
        }
        else {
            alert("Total under $50 -> No discount applied");
        }
    
        </script>
